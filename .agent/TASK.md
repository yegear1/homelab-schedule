## Active Task

- **Task:** `[02.16.4]` HIG Agenda Core (`JobsPage`, `JobTimelineView`, and `JobCalendarView`)
- **Status:** `RUNNING`
- **Scope:**
  - Apply existing semantic tokens and shared visual patterns to the agenda table, timeline, and calendar.
  - Preserve DOM IDs, view switching, filters, keyboard navigation, and job action contracts.
- **Approval:** User approved the agenda presentation plan on 2026-10-31.
- **Plan:**
  1. Apply existing semantic surface, label, separator, accent, and motion tokens to the agenda table, timeline, and calendar.
  2. Align filters, view switching, job actions, and empty/loading/error states with shared presentation patterns; preserve DOM IDs, payloads, grouping, and navigation behavior.
  3. Provide responsive layouts, 44 px touch controls, visible keyboard focus, accessible names, and reduced-motion behavior.
  4. Run all listed validation commands, document presentation decisions, create an atomic Conventional Commit, and log its hash before promoting the next task.
- **Validation:** `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `uv run pytest -v`, `uv run mypy .`, `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check` must exit with code 0.

### Next Planned Tasks

## Backlog (Upcoming, in priority order)

- [ ] **[02.16]** Health Metrics and Operational Summary in MCP (`health_metrics` and aggregate status)

---

## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

## Future Backlog / Ideas (Unprioritized)

- [ ] **[02.8]** User Accounts: Phone OTP + Password + Browser Session (Deferred pending operator evaluation)

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Full spec only when an item becomes the active task.
3. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task). Cycle wrap-up and `[99.1]`: see `AGENTS.md`.
