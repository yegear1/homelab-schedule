## Active Task

- **Task:** `[02.16.3]` HIG Support Screens (`TemplatesPage`, `ContactsPage`, and `ContactDetailPage`)
- **Status:** `RUNNING`
- **Scope:**
  - Apply existing semantic tokens and shared visual patterns to the three support screens.
  - Preserve DOM IDs, form contracts, keyboard navigation, and action handlers.
- **Approval:** Detailed plan approved by the user on 2026-10-31; implementation in progress.
- **Plan:**
  1. Apply existing semantic surface, label, separator, and motion tokens to `TemplatesPage`, `ContactsPage`, and `ContactDetailPage`.
  2. Align cards, lists, forms, and action controls with the shared shell and modal presentation; provide responsive spacing, visible keyboard focus, and reduced-motion behavior.
  3. Preserve DOM IDs, field names, state markers, API payloads, and action handlers; keep changes within these support screens and necessary shared presentation styles.
  4. Run all required frontend and backend checks, review the diff, document relevant decisions, and create an atomic Conventional Commit before promoting `[02.16.4]`.
- **Validation:** `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `uv run pytest -v`, `uv run mypy .`, `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check` must exit with code 0.

### Next Planned Tasks

- **[02.16.4]** HIG Agenda Core (`JobsPage`, `JobTimelineView`, and `JobCalendarView`)
- **[02.15]** Fast Tabular CSV Export for Jobs and Execution History (`job_runs`)

## Backlog (Upcoming, in priority order)

- [ ] **[02.16]** Health Metrics and Operational Summary in MCP (`health_metrics` and aggregate status)

---

## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

---

## Future Backlog / Ideas (Unprioritized)

- [ ] **[02.8]** User Accounts: Phone OTP + Password + Browser Session (Deferred pending operator evaluation)

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Full spec only when an item becomes the active task.
3. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task). Cycle wrap-up and `[99.1]`: see `AGENTS.md`.
